Organisation
------------------------------------
This repository is organised in 4 folders:

* [quizzes](./quizzes) - Quiz questions and related skeleton code. You will need to complete the coding exercises in this folder (in place of existing code) and then `commit` and `push` your code before the deadline. You will also receive feedback to quizzes in this folder.
* [skeleton](./skeleton) - Skeleton code to be used for assignments 
* [tutorials](./tutorials) - Tutorial questions, skeleton code and solutions 
* [scratch](./scratch) - Your own private folder, to back-up your code and assignments

You can create additional folders if you want.

Tips
------------------------------------
* **Use the scratch folder** for any of your own work on in-class material and assignments
* **AVOID editing the skeleton folder otherwise you may encounter git merge conflicts.** Instead copy the folders/files needed into your scratch folder and thereafter edit them and commit
