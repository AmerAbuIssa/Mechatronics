Week0 Information
=========================

First and foremost, the subject is delivered on Linux OS (Ubuntu), canvas has material about navigating Linux file system. Then we move to CMake, which is the build system used, this let's you compile code and create libraries and executable(s) and introduced Visual Studio Code as Integrated Development Environment, to write and compile code.

It is *ESSENTIAL* you have Linux installed and have compiled our sample code to be able to partake in Week 01 activities.

Ex01 - Compiling cmake projects (command line only)
---------------------

Compile [hello.cpp](./starter/hello.cpp) following example on canvas for compling code on the command line. This involves:

* changing directory to starter folder (inside tutorial/week00 of your github)
* create build directory 
* run cmake
* run make
* run executable 
* modify cout text to use your name "Hello <YOUR_NAME>" 
* rebuild and run
* commit modified project (without build products) to your github repository

Ex02- Compiling cmake projects (vscode)
---------------------

Compile [hello.cpp](./starter/hello.cpp)

* create build directory
* start vscode ``code``
* rebuild and run
