"With great power comes great responsibility"; the phrase dates back to the French Revolution and is popularized by the Spider-Man series. In programming circles, it is related to the concept of threading.

Threads are essential for modern processors to keep up with the many tasks. As you read this now, there could probably be two dozen or so threads running on your device. The capacity to run threads is what differentiates systems on chip from simple microcontrollers. We will introduce threading in the subject this week, together with tools that let you mitigate data access issues between threads.

Before commencing the tutorial, compile and get the feel of how threads work and the power of mutexes using the **[Prework](./PREWORK.md)**

We will then, in class, work on more compelling examples, moving from threads in a main (which we will never use), to threads in a class and practical use of threads to drive the `Ackerman` in the **[Tutorial Questions](./TUTORIAL.md)**
