    //! and check the output

    //! Your classes that you develop (here this is Rectangle) will be tested
    //! using the unit tests in the test folder
    //! The classes that are tested should NEVER take user input
    //! You should avoid output to console in these classes

    //! You can use the main to take user input and create objects
    //! and use functions to check the output
